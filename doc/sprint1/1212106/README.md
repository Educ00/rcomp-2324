## 3. Outlets and  Acess Points ###
### 3.1. Outlets ###
#### 3.1.1. Overview ####
| Floor  | Outlets |
|:------:|:-------:|
| Ground |   72    |             
| First  |   120   |   

    The network outlets were placed on the walls of each room 1 meter from the ground. These
    devices were placed on strategical places of each room to minimize the cable costs related to
    its length.
    We should note that in any place of a room a network outlet is at most 3 meters away.

| First  |       2       |          -           |

    The access points were placed in the ceiling of both floors. On the ground floor, 4 of them were placed covering a radious of about 6-7 meters.
    On the first floor, only 2 were needed covering a radious of 15 meters, granting full WI-FI coverage to the entire building.


## 4. Cross-Connections ##

    Only 2 HCCs are needed in this building, 1 per floor.
