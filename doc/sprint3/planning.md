### 3. Technical decisions ###


#### 3.2. OSPF dynamic routing ####

    Static routing will no longer be used, thus on every router, the existing static routing tables should be
    erased, the only exception is the default route established in the building 1 router.

    OSPF area ids to be used in each building must be settled on the planning meeting, each building is
    required to use a unique id.
    The team member in charge of building 1 must insert into the OSPF routing protocol the default route,
    pointing to the ISP router (default-information originate command).

#### 3.3. HTTP servers ####

    In addition to the already existing server, in each building, a new server must be added to the local DMZ
    network, as the former, it will have a manually set IPv4 address. On this server, the HTTP/HTTPS
    service is to be enabled, and a simple HTML page should be created, the page should at least identify the
    building it belongs to.

#### 3.4. DHCPv4 service ####

#### 3.5. VoIP service ####

#### 3.6. DNS ####

    DNS domain name: rcomp-23-24-dg-g3
    DNS local domain name: building-X.rcomp-23-24-dg-g3
    Unqualified DNS domain name: ns.rcomp-23-24-dg-g3
    Unqualified DNS local domain name: ns.building-X.rcomp-23-24-dg-g3

#### 3.7. NAT (Network Address Translation) ####

#### 3.8. Static Firewall (ACLs) ####
